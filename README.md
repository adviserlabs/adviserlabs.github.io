Welcome to the homepage for Adviser! Adviser is a self-hostable high-performance computing engine written in Python with a CLI client written in Go. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry for researchers familiar with software development but unfamiliar with the details of cloud computing.

Some features we're especially proud of include:
* A single CLI command, `adviser run`, can be used to run arbitrary code in any programming language.
* Any AWS or Azure cloud storage can be mounted to each job.
* The self-hostable adviser-cloudproxy service is capable of concurrently running jobs for any number of research organizations or independent users, all with a single AWS or Azure account.

For examples of what Adviser is capable of, have a look at our [demos](https://github.com/adviserlabs/demos).

## Who we are

We're a team of software engineers distributed across the United States. For more, see [Adviser Labs](https://www.adviser.sh/company).

## Thanks

Several people and organizations have made this project possible. We're grateful to the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) and [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) for their generous financial support, and none of this would be possible without [SkyPilot](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/latest/docs/index.html) for its instance provisioning and storage mounting support for AWS and Azure.
